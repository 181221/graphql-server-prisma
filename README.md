# Graphql server with Prisma

## Dependencies

## Notes

1. you should fix volumes for docker-compose file
2. command should be change when server is production ready
   from

```sh

to

command: bash -c "yarn prisma deploy && yarn start"
```

also set PRISMA_MANAGEMENT_API_SECRET in Dockerfile-alternative to something other than my-secret

## Environment variables

1. touch a .env.development and a .env.production in root dir

| Key            |        Value        |
| -------------- | :-----------------: |
| APP_SECRET     |     very secret     |
| RADARR_API_KEY | your radarr api_key |
| EMAIL          |        email        |
| EMAIL_PASSWORD |      password       |

Email and password is for nodemailer to send notifications.

2. prisma configurations at prisma/prisma.yml

## Structure

server starts at src/index.ts.
setInterval function is scanning for movies in radarr to see if they are finished. If they are a user gets a notification via mail iff they have notification set to true.

```sh
const movieUpdatePushRequest = async ()
```

is a method that subscribes to a movie update. When server sees that a movie has been downloaded, it will update the movie and movieUpdatePushRequest will run and send push request to the user via mail.

For push request you should set up a mail service
